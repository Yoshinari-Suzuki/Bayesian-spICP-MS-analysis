"Bayesian estimation to deconvolute single-particle ICP-MS data with a mixed Poisson distribution"

In this paper, to deconvolute spICP-MS data, which is obtained by setting the dwell time similar to the particle event duration time, we applied Bayesian estimation (BE) with a mixed Poisson distribution. Adequate estimation results could be obtained using the BE method, as well as the conventional criteria (CC) method. Compared to the CC method, using a specific informative prior distribution to the BE method enabled us to obtain reasonable estimates even when the count signal was as low as 4 counts or less and the background counts were high.
