This repository is *Supporting information* for the article entitled "Bayesian estimation to deconvolute single-particle ICP-MS data with a mixed Poisson distribution", which is published in the *Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry*.

In this paper, we hypothesized that describing a data generation process as a statistical model would be a useful approach that would not use criteria and would not require taking the sum of intensities for particle-event. To deconvolute spICP-MS data, which is obtained by setting the dwell time similar to the particle-event duration, we applied the Bayesian estimation (BE) method with a mixed Poisson distribution model. Adequate estimation results could be obtained using the BE method, as well as the conventional criteria (CC) method. Compared to the CC method, using a specific informative prior distribution to the BE method enabled us to obtain reasonable estimates even when the count signal was as low as 4 counts or less and the background counts were high. Although the BE method provides better estimation results than the CC method in limited situations, it is a valuable alternative tool for analysing spICP-MS data.
